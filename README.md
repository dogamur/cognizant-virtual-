# The Aim: “Can we accurately predict the stock levels of products, based on sales data and sensor data, 
# on an hourly basis in order to more intelligently procure products from our suppliers.”
# this task was in advanced level while I am still a beginner, I wanted to challenge myself and go through walkthrough and try to understand the code. Conceptually it all made sense and since it is in python it was easy to understand. However,
# I am not yet ready to apply all of these concepts by myself. Having used Tableau before, it was cool to see how merging occurs code-wise. Additionally I've joined a boostcamp in qwiklabs before, which I thought was easier to use.
